                <img src="./LittleLemon/Little.jpeg">
                <p class="parag">At Lemon Restaurant, we believe in the power of lemons. Our founder, Chef Lemon, has been passionate
                    about lemons since childhood. He grew up in a lemon grove, where he learned to appreciate the
                    fruit's versatility and flavor. After years of experimenting with lemon-based recipes, Chef Lemon
                    opened his first restaurant. Today, Lemon Restaurant is known for its innovative dishes and
                    refreshing flavors. We invite you to experience the zest for yourself!</p>
